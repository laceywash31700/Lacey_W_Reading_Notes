# Class-06 Reading Notes

## What Is Rest?

Only the architecture of the internet that changed how we as humans make and share information. No big deal.

> 1. ***Who is Roy Fielding?***
> He's some really smart guy that helped write thr first web servers and he did some Research on why the web works the way it does his names on the specification for the protocol that is used to get the pages from servers to our browsers which is kind of cool and a big deal.
> 2. ***Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?***
> When we code a website for class and put it on github the code is on github and it is a resource for other machines to use but the thing is the information images and other stuff we put on there isn't available for all machines in the world so we have to fine a way for it to be connected to the internet via a server. if we did that from our local computers our computers would have to run all day. So we use services like github and netlify to put that code resource on a remote server so it can do all the work for use and if we are talking about data we most of the data we put on our websites are local and controlled so if we wanted to say have reviews of local restaurants in a area we would need to upkeep that so we can put that in our code. thats where API's come in. API are kind of like a library of information or logic that can be used to process information or data. It does more than that but thats the gist.
> 3. ***What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?***
> HTTPS is a way for a computer to find information anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world as long as you are connected to wifi.It's like a longitude and latitude for information on the web. and it is the truth without it machines would have no idea where any information is that isn't locally on you machine. think of it a noun for every machine to agree upon which to give context is a URL.that is another way of looking at it.
> 4. ***What does a GET do?***
> GET is a part of the HTTP process its a noun but for machines. machines are kind of dumb they might have different verbs for the noun or URL you have typed into the browser. so HTTP is a also a verb to get that noun or information we put into our browser. I to think of it like go here if you think of you phone as a set of rollerblade's a scooter and your tablet as a bike or skateboard and your laptop as a motorcycle or moped and your desktop as a car  or truck. The one thing they all have in common is that they are all modes of transportation to get to a location or resource. they all GET you there some in different speeds or fashions but, instead of you moving there the machine moves the resource to you and not you moving to the resource.
> 5. ***What does a POST do?***
> In My analogy of your machine being a mode of transportation the HTTP is like a road to get there or get that resource the URL is the addy(address) or coordinates. now let say you get there and you need to leave some thing there. You leaving or adding something there would be a POST in HTTP eyes.
> 6. ***What does PUT do?***
> now let say you need to take something from the place you just got to like downloading a file so you can play The Sims 4 or have some DLC on your machine yeah? well HTTP lets you put things on there.
> 7. ***What does PATCH do?***
> now PATCH is a little different it sounds like a PUT request but its a little different. if the road you took to get to a location using a URL was damaged it would use PATCH to update that road so you could better get to that location drama free no traffic involved that is a basic run down of HTTP and why what Roy Fielding and his friends created is such a big deal we. As humans with the processing power our brains have. We have the power of abstraction we can understand information in a variety of different ways while machines are limited to only the way they are programmed to understand that information. HTTP protocol and API's let us both communicate with them in a way both we and the computer can understand so humans and computers which are becoming smarter everyday can work together to do all types of cool stuff; like, make art and share it, make and play video games, and share information a doctor could read in a medical journal or as data and share and update research for all doctors and civilians to use to help make a new medication or techniques that can save someones life.

## API Keys

> Yes I got them all.
