# Class-04 Reading Notes

## React Forms

> 1. ***What is a ‘Controlled Component’?***
> A controlled component is a element that state is usually internally kept is combined with react set state and making it the "single source of truth" so that when that state is changed and vise versa when something is done to change state value is whatever you set state to be.
>
> 2. ***Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.***
> As soon as they submit it because we make the state of the form the same as the react state when they submit it it become the the state of react.
>
> 3. ***How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?***
> We make an object that holds the value of the event target and wrap that around a setState method.

## Conditional(Ternary) Operator Explained

> 1. ***Why would we use a ternary operator?***
> Because it is more efficient and we can write one line of code or even two lines of code for something that would be 3 lines.
>
> 2. ***Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:***
>if(x===y){
> console.log(true);
>} else {
> console.log(false);
>}
>
> (x===y)?console.log(true):console.log(false)
