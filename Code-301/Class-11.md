# Class-11 Reading Notes

## PLACEHOLDER1

> 1. ***Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:***
**SQL**
it is relational
you have to follow a schema
vertical scalability is probably your only option with SQL
this one uses tables for data 

**NoSQL**
this one is non relational 
this looks kinda like JSON data
this can be horizontally scaled or vertically.
NoSQL is more dynamic
there is no strict schema
>
>
> 2. ***What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?***
> any data that has query intensive databases
>
> 3. ***Give a real world example.***
> i would think like the amazon search filter how you can filter out a product by price
>
> 4. ***What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?***
> hierarchical  data 
>
> 5. ***Which type of database is best for scalability?***
> NoSQL all day

## PLACEHOLDER2

> 1. ***What does SQL stand for?***
> structured query language.
>
> 2. ***What is a relational database?***
> in SQL they use a relational structure to organize and reference data its basically tables or buckets that are connected through some interactions from a query  and its powerful databases that need a strong structure I'd use this.
>
> 3. ***What type of structure does a relational database work with?***
>there are one to one where there is a relation with two tables of data that connects one to the other. one to many where there is one table connected to multiple different data tables. many to many where its just all over the place.
>
> 4. ***What is a ‘schema’?***
> a schema is a structure or mandatory structure for your database.
>
> 5. ***What is a NoSQL database?***
> its loosey goosey here babe, NoSQL databases are cool with you having your data in different tables or whatever they can have relations but its not necessary to connect them. they are just as powerful as SQL allowing for more faster response time because the data is kinda just there while SQL is limited by having to follow the schema and reference its self MonDB just coast.
>
> 6. ***How does it work?***
> its has collections and those collections have documents and there is no schema so some ids can having missing information. its flexible like that.
>
> 7. ***What is inside of a MongoDB database?***
> collection of documents but really its freedom.
>
> 8. ***Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.***
> mongoDB you can be more dynamic with it. 
>
> 9. ***What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?***
> its a nightmare to update because the the collections may have repeated data that need to be updated across the data base and it can get kinda messy.
