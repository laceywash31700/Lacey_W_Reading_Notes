# Class-07 Reading Notes

## An Introduction to Node.js

> 1. ***What is node.js?***
> it's a program that devs can be used to run javascript code on other computers. if you watch naruto its kinda like naruto's rasengan it channels javascript code and condenses it so that we can run it on multiple computers. it can be combined with other programs and libraries to make more dynamic web apps like naruto can combine his rasengan with other jutsu. it makes making a server easy and efficient so you don't have to learn another language to make a server for web apps
> 2. ***In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?***
> going back to mu Naruto terminology th v8 engine is like  ninja tool like a suriken or kunia knife. it can be used in conjunction with javascript which in this terminology is like jutsu but for devs can use to make there code more efficient and faster with better memory management.and whats really cool about v8 is that it makes methods that work for specific situations like how Tenten has the right ninja tool for the right situation.
> 3. ***What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?***
> it means that you can run js code outside of a web browser. the runtime allows devs to interact with the server environment something that client side can not do so it like a sharingan in a way. so node is like a rasengan because it compiles your code and condenses it for better management to my understanding you can have multiple connects at once, its also a ninja tool because it lets you use write code more optimized and efficient. and finally sharingan because lets you run code outside of a web browser allowing you do all the work of a server with out having to learn a server based language. and it does all of these thing all at once.
> 4. ***What is npm?***
> its a package manager it allows you to down load javascript code or libraries and its the worlds largest software registry.
> 5. ***What version of node are you running on your machine?***
> v19.9.0
> 6. ***What version of npm are you running on your machine?***
> 9.6.3
> 7. ***What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?***
> npm install -g jshint if you want it installed globally.
> 8. ***What is node used for?***
> it is used to make web apps more dynamic and efficient and to allow devs to interact or build servers without a web browser.

## Reasons for Pair Programming

>  1. ***What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?***
>
> - it offers greater efficiency
> - engaged collaboration.
> - gets you ready for wild.(professional coding)
> - learning from others.
> - helps with social skills.
> - gets you interview ready.
>
> 2. ***In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?***
>
> definitely the Social skills and work place readiness.
>
> 3. ***How does pair programming work?***
>
> there's a driver and navigator. The driver is the only one that is actually coding and writing the syntax while the navigator looks for errors in logic or syntax while simultaneously looking up possible
