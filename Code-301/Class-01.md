# Class-01 Reading Notes

## Component-Based Architecture

I'm back bigger better sort learning about components based architecture cuz of react which I understand is a library of user interfaces or something along those lines. And works a little different from how we have been coding our work using object oriented design. so think of it like a object that already been made in the factory like a car part the car is what you want to make or design or fix what ever and you need that component that is designed to do a task or thing to make the car move. instead of making the car part it already comes boxed up and you can take it out a use in that car and order it again to use on another car you are working on.

> 1. ***What is a "component"?***
> on that not what is a component. well like a said a component is a already made and defined object basically. but the difference is that it is reusable.
> 2. ***What are the characteristics of a component?***
>components are like portable ,which I don't quite get yet, replaceable and reusable set of logic that encapsulated or confined into something of a node of code and I like to think of it like the dom but for javaScript and we can use that node of code to do stuff in a particular set of ways.
> 3. ***What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?***
 unlike object oriented architecture where you literally have to create the object you want to manipulate component-based is already created its just not defined. and because that the nodes of code be used in different parts of the document or interface.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

so we have the car part need lets say we got spark plugs. now we need a way to remove the old ones and put in the new ones that where props in my head come in they are what glue the car parts together or the tools used to do it.  

> 1. ***What is "props" short for?***
>properties
> 2. ***How are props used in React?***
>props are used to transfer data and literally like a tube to share resources. or a tool to connect them
> 3. ***What is the flow of props?***
props only flow in one direction from parent component to child component. the props data can be passed to the grandchild and so forth. and the important thing is that its read only so logic can be used more efficiently I see how react is kind of cool.

## Things I want to know about

1. What do they mean by integrating processing logic in the conventional view of components are they sharing data or sharing a task we are defining when we create the file.
