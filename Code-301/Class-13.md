# Class-13 Reading Notes

## CRUD Basics

> 1. ***Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?***
> Update or put they are synonymous to each other.
>
> 2. ***Which REST methods require an ID parameter?***
> You need them for a patch or update and a delete method because you need the id to accurately target what you want in the database.

## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

> 1. ***Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?***
> Crud and rest are basically the same. They just use different words.
-delete in CRUD correlates to delete in REST.
-create in CRUD is basically a post in REST.
-update in CRUD IS a put in REST.
-and finally read in CRUD is a post in REST.
>
> 2. ***If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?***
>  you need to create a server that is connected to a database.
then you need to create a route that that gives response based on the request that comes from the front end.
then you need to make a route for each HTTP protocol.
then you make a middle ware and make a listener and port for you api.
then you have to test and see if everything works and is bug free.
