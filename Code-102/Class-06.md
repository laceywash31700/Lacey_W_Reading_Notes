## What is javascript

Javascript or Js adds dynamic to websites and gives them funtionality. think of js as programming at its finest. it lets you. 
- it lets you determine if something is true or false via **if else** statments 
- lets you make a **function** which sounds just like it sounds it lets you add functionallity or logic to the code so you dont have to repeat your self
- do animations 
- and create API **WHICH ARE JUST FUNCTIONS**
## what is a variable 
- something that can change or be set 
- output -what comes in
- user input - what goes in for your code to 
-  if else conditions - lets you determine if a variable is true or false 

## some coding basics 
here are are code that may help you use java better. Its important to note **put all variables in lowercase for better code**

(=) - defines a variable 
(==) - equals a values equality  
(===) - equals a variable and looks for a common trait 
(()) - runs/envokes a program 
(//) - for staring a commit 
(++ or --) - depending on the position of the marker you will be able to add by one or subtract by one if it is **behind a variable** *the program will run first and then add or subtract for the next code you create.* **when in front of a variable** *the opposite happens.*
