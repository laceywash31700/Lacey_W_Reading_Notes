# Class-04 Reading Notes

## What the heck are wireframes?

> I'm so glad you asked, now Lace you know a bit 
about this from the google ux design course you're 
also taking But, to clarify a wireframe is 
essentially a blueprint for a baby website or app. 
it would include where a photo might go on a web 
page and etc. They are usually made by a ux 
designer or product designer so a engineer would 
usually just code there creation or prototype; none 
the less it's probaly a good idea for a coder to 
learn about them if they were to be put in that 
role via a start up company. because from what I 
here coders make the best ux designers.

## How should it look?
whoa, whoa, whoa my guy. Calm the f@#% down. Unless 
you doing it for funsies you should probaly 
**do research** on what the user or client
would want in this wireframe and as you know **research is the most important part of the design process** the reason that is is because your research will determine how it would look. there are many factors for what my determine the best process but for me as a future software dev my process would look like this. 

wireframe>Interactive protype>visual>design

it also important to **think about how it would flow for the user.**

Heres an example wireframe I pulled from the reading. 

### Example.
*Pay particular attention to how it would flow if you were a user.*

## Now how do I make my wireframe look like that?

Well my future coding friend which is me or you Lacey should **follow these six steps**.

1. **DO YOUR F%#@ING RESEARCH?**

need I tell you again foolish human you cant make a good site or app if you don't know what your user or client wants. **Understand the f#$&ing assignment**. 

2. **Organize that research cuz.**

Now I know how messey you be I'm literally you typing this right now. but for making a app or website you gotta keep it together bruh.**Make a cheatsheet of your research to come back to for reference.** 

3. **Map out how the user will traverse your wireframe Its gotta flow like water bro**.

make sure the user can easily understand how to navigate your website or app.

4.  **Draft up your wireframe it doesnt need to be f$%#ing Mona Lisa of webpages just sketch it like a outline** 

now this is were you draw it up you can actually draw it w pen and paper which is easy but i know you want to be neat. you type A f&$%. so try using InVision a ux design website for making wire frames its a great place to collab too.

5. **Now you need and just a little detail.**

Dont go too crazy here this is just a skeleton bro just add some joints eye sockets phalanges you know those things that you are using to type remember anatomy 101 right? idk but **at this point you showing people so make sure its usable**
 
 6. **Now make that s@^T pop by making your first fancy smacy prototype**

 this is were InVision comes and goes all freza black on that wireframe and make it look all professional so you can know how you want it to look for coding. 


 # Now Whats HTML
 
 You remember code 101 just look at your notes and 
 youtube **its the building blocks of a website**. 
 its usually just text and images and looks super 
 ugly when you code it but remember this. 

 1. tags- imagine you have a box right and you label it and you know that kitchen stuff goes there and inside of the box you wanna add your kitchen towels so you make another box and put the kitchen towels in the box you labels kitchen stuff. tags are just labels for boxes and html is just a big ol box of information
