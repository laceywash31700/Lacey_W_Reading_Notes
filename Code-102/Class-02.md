### __How I can remind myself to remain in a growth mindset__

1. Understand that every critisim is there to help you be your best self. 
2. When you make mistakeS and feel frustrated because you will say this phrase "How human of me." or try singing out your negative thoughts like if you think to yourself I'm worthless try singing "I'm worthless".

# Top three proficiencies strengths.

1. Openness

- I tend to be really open to feedback and use it as a means to better myself and grow. Over the years I have grown to view criticism from others as a desire from that person for me to grow.  

2. Ambition and initiative

- Right now in this stage of my life I'm more determined than ever to achieve my goals and learn new skills. My long term goal right now is to learn programing so,  I can one day work at google or microsoft.

3. Ownership  

- I have always believed in Taking ownership for my actions and, holding myself accountable for the work me and my team does rather that be bad or good. I do have a tendency to look for the positive rather than the bad but, I embrace both equally the same.

# Top three areas of growth.

1. Networking

- I am not the most social person. If im being completely honest I'm introvert through and through and, though sometimes it is a strength in certain situations but, as the saying goes "If you want go fast go alone but, if you want to go far go together." I'm still learning to practice that.


2. Confidence

- I sometimes deal with imposters syndrome. it's crazy to see myself in tech because i wasn't and am not the most tech savvy person but, I'm in the process of change my perspective from a fixed mindset to being more growth oriented.

3. Handling Ambiguity  

- I have never been one to been told something ambiguous and just roll with it i need follow up questions and the like to understand what is being asked of me. In my adult life that has been happening more and more lately so, I'm  trying make peace with the unknown as opposed to getting anxiety when I'm not given clear instructions.
