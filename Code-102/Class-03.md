## What is Git?
> git is a version control system that allows developers to work on a code from diffrent enviorments like local and remote drives 

 To understand git you may want to understand the history of git. 
 
 ### History of Git
> 1. **VCS (Version Control System)** 
> - A system that allows you to revist various versions of a file. you can track modification and compare changes so, mistake can easily be remedied 
> 
> 2. **Local Version Control**
> - A local VCS on one database on your harddrive 
>
> 3. **CVCS (Centrralized Version Control)**
> - The need for collaboration lead to CVCS's becoming the next big thing in tech. This system has a single server storing all changes and file versions,
> which can be accessed by various parties. Allowing programmers to streamline the collab process by taking out the need for local drives and giving them more knowledge 
> of team members changes and giving admins more control.
>
> 4. **DVCS (Distributed Version Control)**
> - There was a problem with CVCS's. if the CVCS goes kaput you can't work on work with your team on files or save changes and if the the files on the harddrive become
> corrupted, without a backup, you are fucked and all the work you and your team did would be lost except on local hardrives. To prevent this DVCS's were invinted. 
> DVCS allowed you to mirror repos: that can be used to replace lost data. they can also make multiple mirrored repos allowing programmers to work in teams in various  
> ways to complete joint projects. Which made work flow much easier, which leads us back to git.
