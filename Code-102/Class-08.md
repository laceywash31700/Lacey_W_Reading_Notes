# Class-08 Reading Notes
## What the hell is a **operator** and why she making **expression?**

an expression is a value you you assign a value. 
there are two types of expression:those that have side effect and that evaluate.

so to keep it simple stupid(K.I.S.S) Which is my new thing im gonna use forever is expressions are
is this 3+4 

this is just a fancy way of saying equal(=) subtract(-) add(+) or multiply(*) these are all examples of
**assignment operators** 
now assignment operators are for the most part self explanatory.
but id look up some operators [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators) 
as some have some very niche meanings that you can benifit from.

now **comparision operators** 
are also just as self explanitory but look at the link above to look
some as its not as simple as you may think i also wrote some examples of that in class 6 notes but I'll do some again to
cover my bases.

- equal like if you want to say equal use (==)
- not is just a (!)
- strict equal meaning the two variables have 
- greater than or equal to (>=)

just like the title suggest. A loop is 
a code that js uses to repeat a line 
of code indefinatly or a certain 
amount of time until a condition 
changes the value and stops the loop.

(Keep.it.simple.stupid)
 kinda like how in a video game when 
 you sprint as you move the character 
 animation is constantly looping the 
 faster move speed but when the 
 stamina bar runs out you the loop 
 cant continue. think of loops like 
 that. 

 there are diffrent kinds of loops but they all do the same thing but for now im only gonna talk about two. 

### **what is a for statement for?**
so a for loop just repeats its self until a specified condition is false thr js for loop is similar to the java and c for loop apparently 
it looks something like this 

for ([ initialExpression ]; [ "conditionexpression" ]; [ incrementexpression])
statement 
 
 a better example is 
 for(i=0; < 5; i++ )
 console.log(i)

- i is the initial expression if any is executed. this expression usally intializes one or more loop counters the syntax allows for any expression of any degree of complexity 

- the condition being any number greater than 5 will stop the loop 

- and the increment expression being the amount the intial expression increases 

###  **is learning a while statment worth my "while?" Lol get it**
 a while stament is a little more simple bu does the same thing as a for loop when a condition is false or true depending on how you set it up will go until the condition is met it looks something like this 

 > while (condition)
 > {statement} 
 
 > let n = 0 
 > let x = 0
 > while (n < 3){
 >  n++; 
 >  x += n;
 >}
