## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

The state and dispatch function from useReducer 
can be wrapped in a context provider via useContext, 
enabling components to access them without passing down 
callbacks through multiple levels. This approach 
simplifies the component tree, eliminates prop drilling, 
and enhances the maintainability and scalability of the 
codebase. It offers an efficient and organized way to 
manage shared state and intricate interactions across 
different components, making the development process more 
straightforward and comprehensible.
