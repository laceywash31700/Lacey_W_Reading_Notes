# Class-26 Reading Notes

## React Quick Start

> 1. ***What are the building blocks of a React app?***
> Components: These are the fundamental units of a React application,    
> representing different parts of the user interface.
>  
> JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to define the    
> structure of your UI elements.
>
>  Props: Short for properties, these are used to pass data from parent to child 
  components.

  State: Used to manage component-specific data that can change over time.
  
  Lifecycle Methods: Functions that can be defined in class components to 
  perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle.
  
  Hooks: Functions that allow functional components to use state and other React 
  features.
>
> 2. ***What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?***
>  An HTML element is a standard, predefined tag like <div> or <p> used to 
  structure web content. A React component is a custom JavaScript class or 
  function that encapsulates the behavior and rendering logic of a specific part 
  of a UI. React components can render HTML elements, but they can also contain 
  more complex logic and interactivity.
> 
> 3. ***What is JSX and why do we use it?***
> JSX stands for JavaScript XML and is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It 
  allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. JSX is used in 
  React to define the structure and appearance of UI components. It's used to 
  create React elements that are rendered to the DOM.
>
> 4. ***Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.***
> You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces {}. For   
  example: {2 + 2} or {someFunction()}. This allows you to dynamically insert 
  values or execute functions within your JSX code.
>
> 5. ***Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?***
>  Yes, React and JSX have special features for iteration and conditional logic. 
   You can use map() for iteration and conditional statements like if or the 
   ternary operator to conditionally render components or elements based on 
   certain conditions.
>
> 6. ***How does React know to respond to a userâ€™s inputs?***
> React responds to user inputs through event handling. You can attach event 
  listeners to React elements, and when those events occur (e.g., onClick, 
  onChange), you can define functions that update the component's state or 
  perform other actions.
>
> 7. ***What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?***
> The word that indicates a React component manages data with a Hook is  
  typically "useState," which is a commonly used Hook for managing component state.
>
> 8. ***How can two react components share data?***
> You can share data between React components by lifting state up to a common 
  ancestor component, passing data as props from parent to child components, or 
  using a state management library like Redux or React Context API for global 
  state management.

## PLACEHOLDER2

> 1. ***What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?***
>   Render: This is the process of determining what React elements to display 
    based on the current state and props.

    Commit: After rendering, React updates the DOM to reflect the changes made 
    during the render phase.
    
    Reconciliation: React efficiently updates only the parts of the DOM that 
    have changed since the last render, optimizing performance.
>
> 2. ***How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?***
>   You can trigger updates to a component after the initial render by changing 
    its state using functions like setState (in class components) or by using 
    Hooks like useState or useEffect (in functional components). State changes 
    and certain lifecycle methods can cause re-renders.
>
> 3. ***Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?***
>  No, React does not recreate all DOM nodes on every re-render. React uses a 
   virtual DOM and a process called reconciliation to determine the minimal set 
   of changes needed to update the actual DOM, improving performance.
>
> 4. ***After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?***
> After React has updated the DOM, the browser still needs to repaint and reflow 
  to reflect the changes visually. This step happens automatically as part of 
  the browser's rendering process, and the user sees the change when the repaint 
  and reflow are complete.
