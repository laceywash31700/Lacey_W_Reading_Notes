# Class-01 Reading Notes

## Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

> 1. ***How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?***
>It's a program that devs can be used to run javascript code on other computers. if you watch naruto its kinda like naruto's rasengan it channels javascript code and condenses it so that we can run it on multiple computers. it can be combined with other programs and libraries to make more dynamic web apps like naruto can combine his rasengan with other jutsu. it makes making a server easy and efficient so you don't have to learn another language to make a server for web apps.going back to mu Naruto terminology th v8 engine is like a ninja tool like a shuriken or kunia knife. it can be used in conjunction with javascript which in this terminology is like jutsu but for devs we can use it to make our code more efficient and faster with better memory management.and whats really cool about v8 is that it makes methods that work for specific situations like how Tenten has the right ninja tool for the right situation.
> 2. ***What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?***
>It means that you can run js code outside of a web browser. the runtime allows devs to interact with the server environment something that client side can not do so it like a sharingan in a way. so node is like a rasengan because it compiles your code and condenses it for better management to my understanding you can have multiple connects at once, its also a ninja tool because it lets you use write code more optimized and efficient. and finally sharingan because lets you run code outside of a web browser allowing you do all the work of a server with out having to learn a server based language. and it does all of these thing all at once.
> 3. ***What is Node used for?***
> Like I said above Node can be used for a multitude of things from making APIs, building servers, and making command line tools. its like a swiss army knife but for your terminal.

## Additional Questions

> 1. ***Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?***
> Im really excited to touch up on react and learn about functional components. I know I only scratched the surface of react and there is so much more to learn and touching up on node.js I know it sounds like I get and I do to an extent I want to learn more about to be more comfortable with node.

> 2. ***What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?***
> I want to be better at making servers I get the concepts but I don't really fell like I get what I'm doing. I also want to work on my confidence by the end of this course and move forward into my new career but I after this half I learned that I know a lot but I fell like I don't much of anything.
