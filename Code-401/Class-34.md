# Class-34 Reading Notes

## Review API Server Build

> 1. ***Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.***
> the query is used as a filter word for what information you want to get in a database api while a route is the location of the database 
>
> 2. ***What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:***
***Domain: http://our-site.com***  is the domain of your API.
***v3***  indicates the version of the API you are using.
***model name: stuff***  is the model name you mentioned.
***id: things***  is the specific ID parameter passed within the path of the URL.
>
>
> 3. ***We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.***
> that interface takes in a user name and password and returns a jwt like a pass badge to let the server know that you are legit and are who you say you are.
