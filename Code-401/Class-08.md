## 5 steps to RBAC

> ***What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?***
> RBAC lets you assign roles to team members and allow 
> certain access to commands and information by those withe 
> the proper authorization.
>
> ***Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.***
> Admin over managers. Mangers over staff.
>
> ***What approach might you take to implement RBAC?***
> so the admin would have all the privileges from
> assigning roles to creating and viewing information
>
> the manager would have similar power to a admin but would
> have some few to no restrictions.
>
> and finally staff they would have enough access to do
> there
> job but could not make serious changes with approval from
> manager or admin.

## RBAC-Tutorial

> 1. ***What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.***
> Access rights are associated with roles in the context of
> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC is a model for
> managing access to resources within an organization based
> on predefined roles, and access rights are assigned to
> these roles rather than directly to individual users.
>
> 2. ***Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?***
> Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a
> user successfully undergoes the process of
> Authentication. Authentication is the initial step where
> the system verifies the identity of a user attempting to
> access it. Once the user's identity is
> confirmed, the system proceeds to determine what actions
> and resources the authenticated user is allowed to
> access. This determination of allowed actions and access
> is referred to as Authorization, and it is where Access
> Rights come into play.
>
> 3. ***Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.***
> RBAC gives centralized Control over a project. and it is 
> scalable and flexible.
