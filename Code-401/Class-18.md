> 1. ***What is Amazon API Gateway?***
> it is a managment service for devs to choose the HTTP endpoints for a REST API or websocket API and connect it to backend logic. it can also handle auth, access control, monitoring, and API request tracking. 
>
> 2. ***Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?***
> Within the Serverless ecosystem, API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and

HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups:
> 
> 3. ***How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?***
> because it intergrated well with Lambda services and other AWS services to provide a more robust way 
to handle auth for protecting user data.  to provide a more managed API documentation and mapping 
between endpoint connected to backend services.

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

## Dynamoose

> 1. ***What is Dynamoose?***
> it makes using DynamoDB so much easier and it modeled after the mongoose so the syntax is basically the same and conventient for me because I can't deal with learning a new syntax right now I just got comfortable with what we are learning now and jest. 
>
> 2. ***What are some key features of Dynamoose?***
> High level API, easy syntax(thank God), and Type saftey to name a few there is more but check out [dynamoosejs.com](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction) for more info.
