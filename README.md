# Lacey Washington Reading Notes

Hi I'm Lacey, and I'm 28 years old (he/him) pronouns. 
I come from many diffrent career backgrounds but, right now I'm a microbiologist and I test food samples for listeria.
I'm transitioning from microbiology because I feel that I can make more of a diffrence in the world and make more money by learning the skills of programing and coding which; I'm just learning are two diffrent things. Wild right? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/financing-and-scholarships/) choosing me for the diversity scholarship as I wouldn't have been able to afford all the classes. I'm truly blessed and don't want to waste this opprotunity. A fun fact about myslef is that I love making art. Anything can be art i.e making a music playlist, drawing writing a story or, playing a instrument. For me, my favorite art form is role playing games or Dungeons and Dragons I love the chance to role play as someone diffrent from what I am and be a asshole elf or a timid orc with trust issues because it's fun to create interesting stories with these one dimentional character that develop and grow. Which leads me to the topic of a [growth mindset.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

## _What Is A Growth Mindset?_

- *A Growth mindset is a way of thinking that challeges you to be more kinder to yourself when learning new things; more simply, it's knowing how to learn.*
- *When one decides to adopt a growth oriented way of learning they dont veiw there peers as a competitor but as a teammate in a game where everyone is a winner.*
- *They tend to veiw obstacles very diffriently from those with a fixed mindset which is how most of the world tends to think.*

### __How I can remind myself to remain in a growth mindset__

1. Understand that every critisim is there to help you be your best self. 
2. When you make mistakeS and feel frustrated because you will say this phrase "How human of me." or try singing out your negative thoughts like if you think to yourself I'm worthless try singing "I'm worthless".
3. [Watch this video to assure myself that there is evidence to support that a growth mindset is worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf8FX2sI3gU)

# Top three proficiencies strengths.

1. Openness

- I tend to be really open to feedback and use it as a means to better myself and grow. Over the years I have grown to view criticism from others as a desire from that person for me to grow.  

2. Ambition and initiative

- Right now in this stage of my life I'm more determined than ever to achieve my goals and learn new skills. My long term goal right now is to learn programing so,  I can one day work at google or microsoft.

3. Ownership  

- I have always believed in Taking ownership for my actions and, holding myself accountable for the work me and my team does rather that be bad or good. I do have a tendency to look for the positive rather than the bad but, I embrace both equally the same.

# Top three areas of growth.

1. Networking

- I am not the most social person. If im being completely honest I'm introvert through and through and, though sometimes it is a strength in certain situations but, as the saying goes "If you want go fast go alone but, if you want to go far go together." I'm still learning to practice that.


2. Confidence

- I sometimes deal with imposters syndrome. it's crazy to see myself in tech because i wasn't and am not the most tech savvy person but, I'm in the process of change my perspective from a fixed mindset to being more growth oriented.

3. Handling Ambiguity  

- I have never been one to been told something ambiguous and just roll with it i need follow up questions and the like to understand what is being asked of me. In my adult life that has been happening more and more lately so, I'm  trying make peace with the unknown as opposed to getting anxiety when I'm not given clear instructions.
