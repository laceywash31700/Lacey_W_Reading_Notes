# Lacey Washington Reading Notes

Hi I'm Lacey, and I'm 28 years old (he/him) pronouns. 
I come from many diffrent career backgrounds but, right now I'm a microbiologist and I test food samples for listeria.
I'm transitioning from microbiology because I feel that I can make more of a diffrence in the world and make more money by learning the skills of programing and coding which; I'm just learning are two diffrent things. Wild right? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/financing-and-scholarships/) choosing me for the diversity scholarship as I wouldn't have been able to afford all the classes. I'm truly blessed and don't want to waste this opprotunity. A fun fact about myslef is that I love making art. Anything can be art i.e making a music playlist, drawing writing a story or, playing a instrument. For me, my favorite art form is role playing games or Dungeons and Dragons I love the chance to role play as someone diffrent from what I am and be a asshole elf or a timid orc with trust issues because it's fun to create interesting stories with these one dimentional character that develop and grow. Which leads me to the topic of a [growth mindset.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

### __How I can remind myself to remain in a growth mindset__

1. Understand that every critisim is there to help you be your best self. 
2. When you make mistakeS and feel frustrated because you will say this phrase "How human of me." or try singing out your negative thoughts like if you think to yourself I'm worthless try singing "I'm worthless".
3. [watch this video to assure myself that there is evidence to support that a growth mindset is worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf8FX2sI3gU)
