# Intro

Hi I'm Lacey, and I'm 28 years old (he/him)
pronouns.
I come from many different career backgrounds
but, right now
I'm a microbiologist and I test food samples
for listeria.
I'm transitioning from microbiology because I
feel that I
can make more of a difference in the world and
make more
money by learning the
skills of programming and coding which; I'm
just learning are
two different things. Wild right?
I wouldn't be
here if it
wasn't for [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/financing-and-scholarships/)
choosing me for the diversity
scholarship I wouldn't have been
able to afford all the classes. I'm truly
blessed and don't
want to waste this opportunity.

A fun fact
about myself is
that I love
making art. Anything can be art i.e making a
music playlist,
drawing writing a story or, playing a
instrument. For me, my
favorite art
form is role playing games or Dungeons and Dragons I love
the chance to role play as someone different from what I am
and be a asshole
elf or a timid orc with trust issues because it's fun to
create interesting stories with these one dimensional
character that develop
and grow. Which leads me to the topic of a [growth mindset.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian0/growth-mindset) but before that.

check out my [github](https://github.com/laceywash31700)

## **What Is A Growth Mindset to me?**

- *A Growth mindset is a way of thinking that challenges you
to be more kinder to yourself when learning new things; more
simply, it's
knowing how to learn.*

- *When one decides to adopt a growth oriented way of learning they don't view there peers as a competitor but as a teammate in a game
where everyone is a winner.*

- *They tend to view obstacles very differently from those
with a fixed mindset which is how most of the world tends to
think.*

**Take a look look at this figure to see some of the ways how a fixed and growth mindset contrast*

## **How I can remind myself to remain in a growth mindset**

1. Understand that every criticism is there to help you be your best self.

2. When I make mistakes and feel frustrated because, you will, say this mantra "How human of me." or try singing out your negative thoughts.

3. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf8FX2sI3gU) video to assure myself that there is evidence to support that a growth mindset is worth it.

### Top three proficiencies strengths

1. Openness

- I tend to be really open to feedback and use it as a means to better myself and grow. Over the years I have grown to view criticism
from others as a desire from that person for me to grow.  

2.Ambition and initiative

- Right now in this stage of my life I'm more determined than ever to achieve my goals and learn new skills. My long term goal right
now is to learn programming so,  I can one day work at google or microsoft.

3.Ownership  

- I have always believed in Taking ownership for my actions and, holding myself accountable for the work me and my team does rather
that be bad or good. I do have a tendency to look for the positive rather than the bad but, I embrace both equally the same.

### Top three areas of growth

1. Networking

- I am not the most social person. If im being completely honest I'm introvert through and through and, though sometimes it is a
strength in certain situations but, as the saying goes "If you want go fast go alone but, if you want to go far go together." I'm still
learning to practice that.

2.Confidence

- I sometimes deal with imposters syndrome. it's crazy to see myself in tech because i wasn't and am not the most tech savvy person
but, I'm in the process of change my perspective from a fixed mindset to being more growth oriented.

3.Handling Ambiguity  

- I have never been one to been told something ambiguous and just roll with it i need follow up questions and the like to understand
what is being asked of me. In my adult life that has been happening more and more lately so, I'm  trying make peace with the unknown as opposed to getting anxiety when I'm not given clear instructions.
