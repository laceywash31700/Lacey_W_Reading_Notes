# Intro

Hi I'm Lacey, and I'm 28 years old (he/him) 
pronouns. 
I come from many diffrent career backgrounds 
but, right now 
I'm a microbiologist and I test food samples 
for listeria.
I'm transitioning from microbiology because I 
feel that I 
can make more of a diffrence in the world and 
make more 
money by learning the 
skills of programing and coding which; I'm 
just learning are 
two diffrent things. Wild right? 
I wouldn't be 
here if it 
wasn't for [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/financing-and-scholarships/) 
choosing me for the diversity 
scholarship I wouldn't have been 
able to afford all the classes. I'm truly 
blessed and don't 
want to waste this opprotunity. 

A fun fact 
about myslef is 
that I love 
making art. Anything can be art i.e making a 
music playlist, 
drawing writing a story or, playing a 
instrument. For me, my 
favorite art 
form is role playing games or Dungeons and Dragons I love 
the chance to role play as someone diffrent from what I am 
and be a asshole 
elf or a timid orc with trust issues because it's fun to 
create interesting stories with these one dimentional 
character that develop 
and grow. Which leads me to the topic of a [growth mindset.](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian0/growth-mindset) but before that.

## **What Is A Growth Mindset to me?**

- *A Growth mindset is a way of thinking that challeges you 
to be more kinder to yourself when learning new things; more 
simply, it's 
knowing how to learn.*

- *When one decides to adopt a growth oriented way of learning they dont veiw there peers as a competitor but as a teammate in a game 
where everyone is a winner.*


- *They tend to veiw obstacles very diffriently from those 
with a fixed mindset which is how most of the world tends to 
think.*

**Take a look look at this figure to see some of the ways how a fixed and growth mindset contrast*

## **How I can remind myself to remain in a growth mindset**

1. Understand that every critisim is there to help you be your best self. 

2. When I make mistakes and feel frustrated because, you will, say this mantra "How human of me." or try singing out your negative thoughts.

3. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf8FX2sI3gU) video to assure myself that there is evidence to support that a growth mindset is worth it.

### Top three proficiencies strengths.

1. Openness

- I tend to be really open to feedback and use it as a means to better myself and grow. Over the years I have grown to view criticism 
from others as a desire from that person for me to grow.  

2. Ambition and initiative

- Right now in this stage of my life I'm more determined than ever to achieve my goals and learn new skills. My long term goal right 
now is to learn programing so,  I can one day work at google or microsoft.

3. Ownership  

- I have always believed in Taking ownership for my actions and, holding myself accountable for the work me and my team does rather 
that be bad or good. I do have a tendency to look for the positive rather than the bad but, I embrace both equally the same.

### Top three areas of growth.

1. Networking
- I am not the most social person. If im being completely honest I'm introvert through and through and, though sometimes it is a 
strength in certain situations but, as the saying goes "If you want go fast go alone but, if you want to go far go together." I'm still 
learning to practice that.

2. Confidence
- I sometimes deal with imposters syndrome. it's crazy to see myself in tech because i wasn't and am not the most tech savvy person 
but, I'm in the process of change my perspective from a fixed mindset to being more growth oriented.

3. Handling Ambiguity  
- I have never been one to been told something ambiguous and just roll with it i need follow up questions and the like to understand 
what is being asked of me. In my adult life that has been happening more and more lately so, I'm  trying make peace with the unknown as opposed to getting anxiety when I'm not given clear instructions.
