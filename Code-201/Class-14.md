### wHAT DID GOOGLE LEARN FROM IT'S QUEST TO BUILD THE PERFECT TEAM?

project aristotle changed how we look at teams and what factors make a team a good one effective at completing quality work some may assume that that would mean that the team would have to filled with smart people who are efficient at everything they do but actually that not what makes a good team this study find that there are really two arguably three things that make up a good team that can be umbrellaed under one term Psychological safety.

> 1. ***What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?***

the first main factor is making sure everyone feels safe enough to ask questions without criticism or embarrassment. Making sure that a team feels safe enough to speak there mind is crucial for having a psychologically safe team that is receptive to giving and receiving feed back.
next would be empathy or emotional intelligence being able to see when a team member is upset is crucial for making someone or the team feeling psychologically safe enough to interact. finally I think having good social norms that prioritize communication is a good final drop off it wasn't explicitly said in the article but it seemed like it was what they were saying between the lines.

> 2. ***Evaluate wth details a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety?***

i think the current team i work with is a good example of psychological safety when i got there i was really nervous and was apologizing every four seconds for messing something up. I was starting to doubt if i was supposed to even be there my last job was pretty toxic in the hospital they all were seeming to looking at me with extra attention and i hadn't done anything that warrant that type of attention. At my current job I was sort of expecting the same until a colleague said something that put things into perspective and I felt safe enough to let my hair down and speak about my issues there and at home and I stated goofing around with my coworkers and being more social. I appreciate it there and they are sorta the reason I gave this coding boot camp a shot to better myself.  

> 3. ***What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?***

The impact can be more productivity and a better work life balance for the team and completed quality assignments for the company. this also helps the employee be there best self for work and improve there overall way of life at least when it comes to working on that particular team and company.
