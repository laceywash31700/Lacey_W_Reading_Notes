# Class-10 Reading Notes

## Trouble shooting in JS?

>1.***Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logical Error.***

A syntax error is an error in the grammar of your code that being a semicolon in the wrong place or you you used the wrong symbol in your code. A logical error is a error in your logic of your code so it works but its not doing what you want it to do because you didn't set the logic up correctLy.

>2 ***List a few types of errors that you have encountered in the past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.***

For me a lot of my errors have been either been not a function errors and type errors. At the time of me having the I really had no idea what they where. How I solved them was trial and deep dives into stack overflow and other miscellaneous error when there was no TA. Oh wait I've had the many types of logical errors where I kept getting NaN in my salmon cookies table and all I had to do was change how I organized the code. But I'm relying heavily on the internet for help in this stuff.

>3.***How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?***

I really need to get used to using the dev tools source code and navigating that. When I use it in my last lab they really helped once I got it to do what I it to do. Debugging sounds like it would be something I wouldn't mind doing on the daily this chapter really had me doing a look into the future and thinking that I working toward this being my life and in some ways debugging kinda sucks when you are doing it by yourself. but the triumph when you finally beat it is amazing.

## The JavaScript Debugger

>1 ***How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?***

the javascript debugger is a like a video camera that you can see what your code is doing at specific point in your code. so if something is messing up you can go back and go line by line and see what the logic is doing. but the linter helps in defining where it reads the error so that is a good staring point to rewind our code and find out what actually causing the error.

>2.***Define what a breakpoint is.***

 The breakpoint is where you want your code to stop executing in the debugger tool. you can set it up in chrome by clicking the line number in chrome.


>3.***What is the call stack?***

the call stake is the execution time line for the code and from my understanding it functions like magic the gathering ironically I know most people dont play but this is how it works in my head. So it reads reads the code first then it executes going from the bottom down unless something else takes priority then that code will execute first.
