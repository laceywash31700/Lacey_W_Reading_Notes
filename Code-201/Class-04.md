# How to Add a Hyperlink and what it is?

So hyperlinks are apparently a big deal. They are what make the web a web and link web pages to other web pages. Like a door connecting two rooms together. I suppose I never thought about them this way. Now this is provided you have the Wifi and DNS connection from the server. they also provide navigation in a website and can connect audio files, image files, video files, and local links together. they are like really important I guess I've had them for so long that I never thought how they really are the cement of the internet.  


>1. ***To create a basic link. we warp text or other content inside what element?***

If you want to create a hyperlink  would use <(a)> tag for example if you want to make a link to a web site it would look something like this <(a) href= website.com>this is a link</(a)>

>2. ***The href attribute contains what information?***

the href attribute would contain the website url to get to that website it is the attribute that holds the link to the website.

>3. ***What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?***

So for most cases you use would use the title attribute to add a description of the link and where it goes but if you are dealing with a client that uses a screen reader you would want to add the description in the content. 

## What are CSS Layouts?

so, this is embarrassing but i dont understand this lay out stuff in CSS but i will try to explain so the layout is the way the content is shown in a document. you can use different properties to change the layout of a doc in CSS for example you can use the display to change a element from a inline to a block or an inline-block and even more. 

>1. ***What is meant by 'normal flow'?*** 

Normal flow is how HTML documents are layed out by default. no CSS changes or anything. 


>2. ***What are few differences between block level and inline elements?***

block level elements grows along the 
block dimension to accommodate its 
content the content fills available 
inline space. the inline element can 
be in the block element and is the 
size of their content.unlike block 
elements you cant change there width 
and length and dont appear on new lines.

>3. ***[static] positioning is the default for ever HTML element.***


>4. ***Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.***

absolute positioning allows you to move an element out of the pages normal layout flow. you can sit it on a completely different layer. This opens up the ability to have position it to the edge of the screen and make a separate tab box kinda like or exactly like the tab box that is on the upper left corner of a screen on some web sites that pop out when you click them and has a whole navigation screen. that is some of the the things you can do with absolute positioning 

>5. ***What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?***

they are pretty similar as they both keep a element in the same position but the key difference from my understanding is that absolute positioning puts the element in a position in a completely separate layer from the base content while fixed position keeps the element content on the same layer as the base but it moves as he user scrolls through out the page.


## I freaking love functions. 

Ah functions I love functions because they make programing soooooo much easier. you know how when you programming and you make an if...else algorithm that you want to reuse thought the code so you have to copy and paste every time you want to use that code. functions make it so you dont have to do that. i know right free at last from the redundancy of repetitive code. a freaking game changer. this allows your code to look so much cleaner. you can start a function by just writing the word function out and naming it what ever you want and put the name next to parenthesis that hold parameters that you set in the functions code. 

ex.
function myFunctionsName(x,y,z)
/// functions code that includes the parameters in the parenthesis.


>1. ***Describe the difference between a function and declaration and a function invocation.***

a functions are everywhere in javascript. we kinda use them all the time. a function and declaration is making your own custom made function think of it as a way of adding logic to your computer when you see this and if its this do this else if do this and ect. the else if stuff is the declaration of this is what it does and what it is called. while the invocation of the function is actually saying hey use that function i just declared in this line of code. because when you declare a function you actually aren't using it at all you just saying this function exist. when you invoke it you are saying okay Ju-lee(name my fictional function) do the thing. 

>2. ***What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?***

parameters are values in a functions like this is what i want you to take in. and the argument is what you do with the parameters essentially when you see this do this that is outlined from the declaration of the function. they are really cool convenient. and make my life so much easier and I think think they are just are game changer to programing because they also are the mother of API which is a whole other beast and that gets me equally as excited and get my juices flowing. 


## Six Reasons for Pair Programming.

Pair programming allows a coder to work on a specific thing in the development process allowing for efficiency and accuracy when working on projects. it delegates task to make the process of coding more efficient and reduces the amount of typos in a code. it involves two roles the navigator the driver. the navigator uses there words to guide the driver in but does not do any direct coding while the driver is coding and inputting what the navigator instructs them to code.


>1. ***Pick two benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.***

this would allow me to learn from fellow student. as we know there are mutiple ways of tackling a problem in programming. this pair programming will allow me to see how another would handle a situation in coding that my be more efficient and faster than how I would handle a problem. 

 I also think engaged collaboration is a good idea to start on now because. in the wild when I join the work force I will actually be able working with other programmers this gives room for feed back that can be pivotal in my development as a future software dev
