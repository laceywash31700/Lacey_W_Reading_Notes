# The CommandLine

- So I already was pretty proficient with the commandLine but I had no idea that the shell was a operating system for it legit thought that zsh was just a theme or something.

- man is pretty lit I didn't know the commandLine came with its own dictionary too. gonna use that when i need to do some advanced stuff in my terminal you can even man man. like I never gonna just remember these commands by heart or at least not all of them I did -k with and was shook at how much stuff you can actually do with this terminal that look so simple to be honest I was wondering in 401 why we needed to learn more about the terminal but i get it now I don't even know a fraction of what I can do with it.
